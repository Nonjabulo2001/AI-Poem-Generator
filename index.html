            The poem will written header 
            <br>
            Listen to the snow on earth, falling upon us
From the unknown space. Sky darkensâ€”a line of poetry
Is half complete; the shepherd and his sheep are
Coming down from the hill, through thorns, wetland, exposed
On the Gobi. Snow is decorating the cosmos, as we
Seek our path to get back home, and the mountains are joyful.
